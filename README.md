# next-smart-runner

Helpers that automatically pick the right Next.js bundler (Turbopack or Webpack) for `next dev` and `next build` when you rely on linked or symlinked local packages.

## Why?

Next.js 16 uses Turbopack by default, but Turbopack still struggles with linked packages created via `bun link`, `npm link`, or monorepo workspaces. Those symlinks often cause `Module not found: Can't resolve` errors during development and production builds.

`next-smart-runner` inspects your project's `node_modules` for symlinked packages and automatically falls back to Webpack when needed. When everything is local, it keeps the default Turbopack experience.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev next-smart-runner
# or
pnpm add -D next-smart-runner
# or
bun add -d next-smart-runner
```

## Usage

Update your `package.json` scripts to call the smart runners instead of `next` directly:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next-smart-dev",
    "build": "next-smart-build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

- If a symlinked package is detected (defaults to `goobs-frontend`, configurable via `NEXT_SMART_PACKAGE`), we run `next dev --webpack` or `next build --webpack`.
- Otherwise we call the standard `next dev` / `next build`, letting Turbopack handle the workload.

### Customising the watched package(s)

The scripts check for a symlinked `node_modules/goobs-frontend` path by default. Override the package name (or a comma-separated list) via the `NEXT_SMART_PACKAGE` environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_SMART_PACKAGE="goobs-frontend,shared-ui" next-smart-dev
```

### Windows support

The runners resolve the underlying `next` executable and call it via `node` or `cmd.exe` (on Windows), so they work the same across platforms.

## Publishing

1. Initialise a git repository and push it to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initial release"
   git remote add origin git@github.com:goobz22/next-smart-runner.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. Publish the package to npm:

   ```bash
   npm publish --access public
   ```

   Make sure you are logged in (`npm login`) and that the package name is available.

## FAQ

**Does this replace my Next.js configuration?**

No. It only wraps the CLI commands. You can still use `next.config.*` as usual.

**Can I use this in monorepos?**

Yes. The scripts inspect the current working directory, so as long as you run them from the Next.js app root they work fine.

**What about production builds on CI?**

You can keep Turbopack in CI by running `NEXT_SMART_PACKAGE="" next-smart-build` or call the stock `next build` command. The helpers only change behaviour when a symlink is actually detected.
